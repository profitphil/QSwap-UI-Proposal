# QSwap Standalone Interface Proposal

## Overview

This proposal is to create a dedicated user interface and website specifically for QSwap smart contract operations.  
Currently, QSwap functionality is integrated into Qubictrade.com’s existing interface.  

A separate site would:
- Give QSwap its own brand identity
- Enable customized features
- Operate independently of the Qubictrade platform

**Goal:**  
Make QSwap easier to use and give it room to grow independently.
